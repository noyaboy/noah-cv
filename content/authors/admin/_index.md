## About Me

I am currently pursuing a Master of Engineering in Digital VLSI and System Design at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, working in the Parallel Computing System Laboratory under Professor Lai, Bo-Cheng. I also serve as an Affiliate Trainee in Washington, U.S., optimizing GPU algorithms for particle trajectory reconstruction in HL-LHC HEP experiments.

I earned my B.S. with distinction in Electrical Engineering after transferring from the Physics Department at National Tsing Hua University, where I ranked first in my class. Since November 2024, I have worked as a Digital Design Intern in the AI/Deep Learning Accelerator group at Andes Technology Corporation in Hsinchu, Taiwan, focusing on CPU-related AI and deep learning accelerator development.
