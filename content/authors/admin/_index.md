    summary: "In the Computing Acceleration R&D Division at Andes Technology, I designed and implemented a fully automated, end-to-end workflow—combining CSV interfaces, Python scripts, and templated generators—to produce RTL code, C drivers, and detailed register-file datasheets. This system virtually eliminated manual errors and dramatically accelerated delivery across multiple design configurations. To boost the deep-learning accelerator’s performance and area efficiency, I re-architected its matrix-multiplication adder tree by cascading carry-sum adders in ascending bit-width order, thereby reducing overall gate count. For cycle-accurate power analysis, I created functional-pass bitmaps for the software team, enabling cycle-based power modeling on our neural-network benchmarks. After collecting cycle-count tables, I merged them with gate-toggle data—extracted from full-utilization power-pattern simulations—to perform a fine-grained analysis. Finally, by scaling activity factors over the total cycle time, I translated these combined metrics into precise average dynamic-power estimates for vendors."

    summary: I managed exams and demonstrated physics experiments in mechanics, thermodynamics and wave phenomena by preparing materials, setting up and calibrating equipment, and teaching the procedures. I guided students through each experiment, answered their questions and clarified concepts to strengthen both their theoretical knowledge and practical skills. Afterward, I evaluated their lab reports and provided constructive feedback to support their improvement. I also coordinated the experimental schedule and worked closely with faculty to optimize laboratory sessions and enhance the overall learning experience. Throughout this role, I deepened my understanding of teaching methodologies and honed my oral communication and instructional abilities, which are vital for engaging students effectively.

## About Me

I am currently pursuing a Master of Engineering in Digital VLSI and System Design at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, working in the Parallel Computing System Laboratory under Professor Lai, Bo-Cheng. I also serve as an Affiliate Trainee in Washington, U.S., optimizing GPU algorithms for particle trajectory reconstruction in HL-LHC HEP experiments.

I earned my B.S. with distinction in Electrical Engineering after transferring from the Physics Department at National Tsing Hua University, where I ranked first in my class. Since November 2024, I have worked as a Digital Design Intern in the AI/Deep Learning Accelerator group at Andes Technology Corporation in Hsinchu, Taiwan, focusing on CPU-related AI and deep learning accelerator development.
