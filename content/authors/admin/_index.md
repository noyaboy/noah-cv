## About Me

I am a graduate student in the Institute of Pioneer Semiconductor Innovation at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, focusing on digital VLSI and system design. My research in the Parallel Computing System Laboratory explores hardware–software co-acceleration and next-generation computing architectures.

Professionally, I intern at Andes Technology Corporation, where I develop automation flows and performance analysis for AI/deep-learning accelerators, and I serve as an affiliate trainee in the A3D3 Institute in Seattle, optimizing GPU algorithms for high-energy-physics applications.

I aim to bridge cutting-edge hardware design with data-driven discovery to push the boundaries of intelligent computing.
