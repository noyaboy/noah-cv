  An FPGA-based End-to-end GNN accelerator for HL-LHC particle tracking unifies geometry-aware pruning graph construction, a streaming-optimized edge-classification engine (−52.3 % latency) and a lightweight sequential track builder in one AXI-Stream pipeline, achieving 2.36 μs latency and 2.35 MHz throughput on a Xilinx VU9P—surpassing Level-1 trigger requirements.
summary: FPGA-accelerated GNN pipeline for HL-LHC exceeding latency and throughput requirements.
